# Assets

This folder contains files I changed in my mod of BBAI + some schema files that might be necessary for certain further changes. 

I Could not upload the entire mod as that was 1700 files which github would not accept.

The changes I am most interested in are:

1. The change to CIV4CivilizationsSchema.xml to be able to use your CIV4TraitInfos.xml
2. Showing KTB in tech tree.
3. Lumber Mill and Forest Preserve getting a bonus on river corners.
4. Fail-gold: You never get fail-gold if you also completed the wonder somewhere else 

Changes of possible interest are:

1. Changed circumnavigation bonus
2. New Leaders
3. Bugfixes. But I do not know which of these are already in BBAI
4. Lock specialist feature (so that governor does not use them)
